## Challenge Description

A strange audio file was intercepted from a ham radio transmission claiming to have contacted the International Space Station. However, upon analysis, it seems that it does not contain words, but rather a mysterious pattern of tones. Can you decipher the hidden message sent from space?

## Initial Analysis
My initial idea was to open the audio file in a spectrogram editor to visualize the frequency patterns. For this, I used Audacity.

By switching to the spectrogram view and zooming in a bit, I was able to observe a series of patterns that seemed to repeat over time. I hoped that the flag would be directly written in the spectrogram, but it was not.

The complete spectrogram:

If we zoom in on the beginning, we can see the patterns better:

## Hypotheses about Encoding

Researching types of audio encoding, I found some of these options:
- **Morse Code**: Used in radio transmissions. It is characterized by short and long tones (dots and dashes). Listening to the audio, the tones seem to have the same duration, which rules out this option.
- **DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency)**: Used in telephone dialing tones. Each key generates a combination of two frequencies. Our spectrogram shows multiple frequencies simultaneously, which does not match.
- **FSK (Frequency-Shift Keying)**: Used in modems and ham radio. It switches between two frequencies to represent bits 0 and 1. Our spectrogram shows multiple frequencies simultaneously, which does not match. We could consider MFSK (Multi-Frequency Shift Keying, which uses more than two frequencies), but it does not seem to be the case.
- **PSK (Phase-Shift Keying)**: Used in digital communications. It changes the phase of a carrier signal to represent data. Although it is more complex, our spectrogram does not show clear phase changes.

## Delving into the Context

Searching for more information about the International Space Station and in ham radio subreddits, I found that they often transmit SSTV (Slow Scan Television) images. These images are sent using audio tones that represent pixels of the image.

Using [an online SSTV decoding tool](https://sstv-decoder.mathieurenaud.fr/), I uploaded the audio file and obtained the following image:

In the decoded image, although blurry, a text that seems to be the flag of the challenge can be distinguished.
The flag is: `ikerlan{excuse_the_noise_jeje}`.
